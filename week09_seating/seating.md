The algorithm should allow for an adult traveling with children under the age of 10 to be seated next to their guardian for no additional cost. 
For larger families with many kids that app would have to search for seats that are near each other. The algorithm should start with one seat as an anchor and then search and prioritize first seats directly next to that seat. Then it should look in front and behind the anchor seat. The FAA should mandate for such types of arrangments that parents are not supposed to be charged for this seating arrangment.
