Zipgrade stores information such as device information including your operating system, battery and signal strength. 
They also collect information about how frequently you use their service and for how long. They also store IP addresses, hardware settings and brower type. 
Zipgrade states that they do not sell teachers' information nor do they give it to third parties for advertising purposes. They do howeveer share the information
with third party vendors who are involved in sending emails out for them and other functions that zipgrade themselves doesn't perform. 
However, they state that these third parties are not able to use this data for advertising either under agreements they have with them. 

Plickers stores similar type of information such as IP address, location, name and photo of teacher (if they shared it). They also store aggregated de-identified
data about students in order to determine the effectiveness of their programs. Just like zipgrade, plickers does share information with third party contractors with
the explicit purpose of improving services but the third parties are also required to not share this information or let it be used for advertising etc.
